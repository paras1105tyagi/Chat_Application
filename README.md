This is a simple Chat Application built using C++ and WinSock2 library.

The project is divided into 2 parts:
a) Client: It is used to send and receive messages.Can enter chat name, type your own message.
b) Server: This helps to deliver messages between clients. It is always runnijng on background.


How does it works?
When you run the client application, it connects to the server. Once connected, you can start sending messages. The server makes sure that messages get to the right place. And if a message is not sent, the application will let you know.

How to Use:
Start the application: Open the application on your computer.
Enter your chat name: The first thing you’ll do is enter a name. This is the name that others will see when you send messages.
Type your messages: Just type your message and hit enter to send it. You’ll see your message, along with your chat name, show up in the chat.
See messages from others: When others send messages, you’ll see them show up in the chat. You’ll see their chat name, along with their message.
Stop chatting: When you’re done chatting, just type “quit” and hit enter. This will stop the application.
